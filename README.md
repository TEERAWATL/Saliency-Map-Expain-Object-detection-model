# Saliency-Map-Expain-Object-detection-model

The project is for generating a saliency map for an object detection model using PyTorch and TorchVision.

Preprocessing and Model Loading: A PyTorch transforms object is created that specifies the preprocessing steps to be applied to the input image. The model used is a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from TorchVision.

Generate Saliency Map: A function generate_saliency_map_torchvision is defined which takes in the model and an image path as input and generates the saliency map. The function first sets the model to evaluation mode, loads the input image, applies the preprocessing steps, and passes the image tensor through the model. The saliency map is generated by computing the gradients of the scores with respect to the input image.

Post-processing: The saliency map is post-processed to normalize it between 0 and 1 and apply a threshold. The original image is also converted to grayscale, contrast is adjusted, and a 3-channel version of the grayscale image is created. The saliency map is resized to the same shape as the grayscale image.

Display the Results: The grayscale image and the overlayed image (grayscale image with the saliency map added to the red channel) are displayed side by side using Matplotlib.

This code can be used as a starting point for further research and experimentation with saliency maps for object detection models.
